# palm-leaf-character-segmentation
A project did to explore the subjects of cv and Neural Networks 
Project Overview:
This project focuses on the segmentation of characters from ancient palm leaf manuscripts. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision techniques, the goal is to accurately segment characters from preprocessed palm leaf images. This segmentation is crucial for further processing and analysis, such as character recognition and translation.
