# palm-leaf-character-segmentation
A project did to explore the subjects of cv and Neural Networks 

##Project Overview:
This project focuses on the segmentation of characters from ancient palm leaf manuscripts. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision techniques, the goal is to accurately segment characters from preprocessed palm leaf images. This segmentation is crucial for further processing and analysis, such as character recognition and translation.

##Introduction:
Ancient palm leaf manuscripts are valuable cultural artifacts that contain historical and literary content. However, due to their age and the manual writing process, these manuscripts often present challenges for digitization and analysis. This project aims to address these challenges by using CNNs for the segmentation of individual characters from the manuscripts.

##Model Training:
The CNN model is trained using the preprocessed images. The architecture and hyperparameters of the CNN can be customized in the code. Training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs can be adjusted in the read.ipynb.

##Results
After training, the model should be able to accurately segment characters from the palm leaf images. You can visualize the segmentation results using the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory.
